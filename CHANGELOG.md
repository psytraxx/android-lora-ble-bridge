## Recent Improvements

### Android App - Connection State Fix & Foreground Service Removal (October 23, 2025)

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **CRITICAL - Connection State Synchronization**: Fixed UI state mismatch where send button was greyed out but status showed "Ready to send"
  - Problem: LiveData connection state could become stale when app went to background and returned to foreground
  - Root Cause: No validation of actual GATT connection state (bluetoothGatt, txCharacteristic, rxCharacteristic) on app resume
  - Solution: Added `validateConnectionState()` method that checks actual GATT objects and forces LiveData update
  - Impact: UI now always accurately reflects actual BLE connection state after screen unlock or app switching
  - File: `BleManager.java:428-464`, `MainActivity.java:186-198`

#### Architecture Simplification
- **Removed Foreground Service**: Eliminated LoRaForegroundService as it's unnecessary with ESP32's message buffering
  - ESP32 already buffers up to 10 messages when BLE disconnected and re-delivers them on reconnect
  - Foreground service caused state synchronization issues between service and MainActivity
  - Reduces app complexity and memory footprint (~2-5 MB savings)
  - Simplifies permission requirements (removed FOREGROUND_SERVICE, POST_NOTIFICATIONS)
  - Files removed: `LoRaForegroundService.java`
  - Files modified: `MainActivity.java`, `AndroidManifest.xml`

#### Code Quality Improvements
- **Scheduled Disconnect Fix**: Prevented multiple overlapping disconnect timers
  - Problem: Each message send scheduled a new 30-second disconnect without cancelling previous ones
  - Solution: Cancel previous disconnect callback before scheduling new one
  - Added `cancelPendingDisconnect()` method for explicit cancellation
  - File: `MessageViewModel.java:165-187`

- **LiveData Update Strategy**: Changed from `postValue()` to `setValue()` for immediate observer notification
  - Ensures UI updates happen synchronously when validating connection state
  - Prevents race conditions between background threads and main thread

#### Test Results
- **Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Unit Tests**: ✅ All 9 tests passing
- **Impact**: Simpler, more reliable app with accurate UI state

### ESP32-S3 Debugger - Light Sleep & Reliability Fixes (October 23, 2025)

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **CRITICAL - LoRa Reinitialization After Sleep**: Fixed LoRa module state corruption when waking from light sleep
  - Problem: SX1276 LoRa module lost RX mode state after ESP32-S3 light sleep, preventing message reception
  - Solution: Added `loraManager.startReceiveMode()` + 50ms stabilization delay after wake-up
  - Impact: LoRa reception now works reliably across sleep/wake cycles
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:244-249`

- **HIGH - Non-Blocking ACK Delay**: Replaced blocking 500ms delay with timer-based implementation
  - Problem: `delay(500)` blocked all operations (button input, display updates, LoRa reception) during ACK transmission
  - Solution: Implemented `ackPending` flag with `ackSendTime` timer for non-blocking ACK scheduling
  - Impact: System remains responsive during ACK transmission, no missed button presses or messages
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:86-90, 612-624, 648-671`

- **HIGH - Display Dimming/Sleep Conflict**: Fixed display dimming timeout triggering during sleep countdown
  - Problem: Display would dim at 10 seconds, then immediately wake for sleep at 15 seconds
  - Solution: Set `displayDimmed=true` during sleep entry, check `timeSinceActivity < SLEEP_TIMEOUT` before dimming
  - Impact: Display only dims when not about to sleep, smoother UX
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:226-227, 673-680`

#### Reliability Improvements
- **Button Debounce**: Added debounce on button release in addition to press
  - Prevents spurious wake events from switch bounce
  - 200ms debounce window on both press and release
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:521`

- **Sleep Re-Entry Race Condition**: Fixed potential race condition in sleep timing logic
  - Calculate `timeSinceActivity` once per loop iteration
  - Prevents edge case where `millis()` wraps during comparison
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:674, 683`

#### Code Quality Improvements
- **Message History Initialization**: Added explicit initialization of message history array in setup()
  - Prevents garbage data on first boot
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:486-491`

- **Display Overlap Fix**: Adjusted button indicator Y-offset to prevent overlap with status line
  - Moved from 24 pixels to 32 pixels above bottom
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:110, 509-510`

- **Magic Number Extraction**: Extracted display layout constants for maintainability
  - `LINE_HEIGHT = 18`, `STATUS_HEIGHT = 20`, `STATUS_LINE_Y_OFFSET = 16`, `BUTTON_INDICATOR_Y_OFFSET = 32`
  - Improves code readability and makes layout adjustments easier
  - File: `esp32s3-debugger/src/main.cpp:111-117`

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Memory Usage**:
  - RAM: 4.2% (13,616 / 327,680 bytes)
  - Flash: 2.9% (192,152 / 6,553,600 bytes)

#### Connection State & UX Fixes
- **CRITICAL - Send Button/Status Mismatch**: Fixed mismatched UI state where send button was disabled but status showed "Ready"
  - Problem: `connected` flag set too early (on BLE connect) before service discovery completed
  - Solution: Only set `connected=true` after full successful connection (MTU, service discovery, characteristics)
  - Added `connected=false` for all failure cases (missing service, missing characteristics, discovery failed)
  - Impact: Send button state now always matches connection status text
  - File: `BleManager.java:248, 330, 334, 339, 344`

- **Reconnect Button Improvements**: All error messages now include "Tap here to reconnect" for consistency
  - Users can always manually reconnect by tapping status text
  - Works for all error states (disconnected, characteristics missing, service not found, discovery failed)

#### BLE Scan Optimization
- **Fast Device Discovery**: Implemented optimized BLE scanning with filters and settings
  - **ScanFilter**: Only scans for devices named "ESP32S3-LoRa" (ignores other BLE devices)
  - **ScanSettings**: LOW_LATENCY mode for fastest scanning
  - **Match Mode**: AGGRESSIVE matching reports device immediately
  - **Impact**: Device found in 1-3 seconds (vs 5-15 seconds previously) in crowded BLE environments
  - **Trade-off**: Higher power during scan, but much shorter scan duration
  - File: `BleManager.java:178-196`
