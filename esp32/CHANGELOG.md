### üîÑ Migration Notes
**Non-Breaking Changes:**
- Existing functionality unchanged
- Sleep is automatic - no configuration required
- Works with existing Android app
- Hardware remains the same

**Optional Configuration:**
```cpp
// SleepManager.h
#define LIGHT_SLEEP_TIMEOUT_MS (2 * 60 * 1000)  // Change timeout
#define MAX_STORED_MESSAGES 10                   // Change buffer size
```

### üìä Performance Impact
- Active power: ~80-120 mA
- Sleep power: ~0.8-5 mA (90-95% reduction)
- Wake-up time: ~few milliseconds (maintains system state)
- Message delivery latency: Instant when BLE connected
- No impact on communication range or speed

### üß™ Testing Scenarios
- ‚úÖ LoRa interrupt wake-up
- ‚úÖ Message persistence across multiple sleep cycles
- ‚úÖ Automatic message delivery on BLE reconnection
- ‚úÖ RTC memory validation
- ‚úÖ LED visual feedback

### üìù Technical Details
- Uses ESP32 EXT1 wake source for LoRa interrupt
- RTC memory structure with magic number validation
- FIFO message queue in RTC_DATA_ATTR memory
- Compatible with ESP32 classic (not S2/S3 specific)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-21

### ‚ú® Complete Rewrite
Completely rewrote the ESP32 firmware to match ESP32-S3 Rust functionality, transforming it from a simple GPS sender to a full BLE-LoRa bridge.

### üéØ Added
- **BLE Manager** (`BLEManager.h`, `BLEManager.cpp`)
  - GATT server implementation
  - Service UUID: 0x1234
  - TX Characteristic: 0x5678 (notifications to phone)
  - RX Characteristic: 0x5679 (writes from phone)
  - Connection state management
  - Auto-reconnect functionality
  - Message serialization/deserialization for BLE

- **Protocol Implementation** (`Protocol.h`, `Protocol.cpp`)
  - 6-bit text encoding for bandwidth optimization
  - Character set: Uppercase, numbers, punctuation (64 chars)
  - Automatic lowercase to uppercase conversion
  - pack_text() / unpack_text() with bit manipulation
  - Message types: Text (0x01), GPS (0x02), ACK (0x03)
  - Serialize/deserialize for all message types
  - Maximum text length: 50 characters

- **Message Handling**
