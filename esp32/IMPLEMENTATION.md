## Code Review Findings and Planned Improvements

### Review Summary
A comprehensive code review was conducted on 21 October 2025, identifying areas for enhancement in reliability, performance, and maintainability. The code is well-structured but has opportunities for improvement, particularly in message buffering and memory management.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Message Queuing and Buffering (High Priority - COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Simple fixed-size arrays used as "queues" that only hold one message each, processed immediately. No true buffering for multiple messages or asynchronous handling.
- **Impact**: Potential message loss during bursts; not thread-safe for BLE callbacks.
- **Solution**: Replace with FreeRTOS queues for FIFO buffering and thread-safety.
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Implemented FreeRTOS queues with sizes 10 (BLE→LoRa) and 15 (LoRa→BLE). BLE callbacks now send to queue; main loop receives from queues. Added queue full warnings.

#### 2. Memory Management and Stability (High Priority - COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Use of `String` objects in `Message` structs causes heap fragmentation. No bounds checking beyond constants.
- **Impact**: Potential crashes in long-running applications due to ESP32's limited RAM.
- **Solution**: Replace `String` with fixed-size char arrays; use static allocation.
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Replaced `String` with `char text[MAX_TEXT_LENGTH + 1]` in `TextMessage`. Updated `pack_text`, `unpack_text`, `createText`, `serialize`, and `deserialize` to use char arrays. Added null-termination and bounds checking.

#### 3. Error Recovery and Robustness (Medium Priority - COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Setup failures halt execution permanently; no retries or watchdog.
- **Impact**: Device becomes unusable after initial failure.
- **Solution**: Add retry logic, software watchdog, and retransmission.
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added 3-retry logic for BLE/LoRa setup with delays. Implemented ESP32 task watchdog (30s timeout). Added LoRa retransmission (retry once on failure). Enhanced ACK send logging.

#### 4. Protocol Enhancements (Medium Priority)
- **Issue**: No message integrity checks beyond LoRa CRC; ACKs sent but not used for reliability.
- **Impact**: Data corruption possible; no retransmission on failure.
- **Solution**: Add checksums, sequence validation, and retransmission logic.
- **Status**: Planned.

#### 5. Configuration and Flexibility (Low Priority)
- **Issue**: Pins hardcoded; settings not runtime-configurable.
- **Impact**: Difficult to port to different hardware.
- **Solution**: Move to build flags and runtime config via BLE.
- **Status**: Planned.

#### 6. User Feedback and Debugging (Low Priority)
- **Issue**: No LED indicators; verbose logging without levels.
- **Impact**: Hard to debug in field; no visual status.
- **Solution**: Integrate LEDManager for status; add logging levels.
- **Status**: Planned.

#### 7. Code Quality and Testing (Low Priority)
- **Issue**: Magic numbers; no unit tests despite test/ folder.
- **Impact**: Maintainability; potential bugs.
- **Solution**: Define constants; add unit tests.
- **Status**: Planned.

#### 8. Performance and Power (Low Priority)
- **Issue**: No sleep modes; constant polling.
- **Impact**: High power consumption.
- **Solution**: Implement deep sleep and event-driven operation.
- **Status**: Planned.

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1 (COMPLETED)**: Implement FreeRTOS queues for message buffering.
2. **Phase 2 (COMPLETED)**: Fix memory management (String → char arrays).
3. **Phase 3 (COMPLETED)**: Add error recovery and robustness features.
4. **Phase 4**: Protocol enhancements (checksums, retransmission).
5. **Phase 5**: Remaining improvements (config, LEDs, testing).

### Notes
- All changes will maintain backward compatibility with existing protocol and Android app.
- Testing will be done incrementally after each phase.
- Documentation will be updated as features are added.
